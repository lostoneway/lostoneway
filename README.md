- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lostoneway
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in tech, fantasy football and the beach. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript with some amazing tools in The Odin Project, Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp & 100Devs. 

<p> Talk about getting out of my comfort zone. From the military to working full-time in telecommunications, I found myself tinkering with forms and front-end at my  current job for fun. Learning to code on my own has been a challenge but so exciting! So I'm here, starting fresh. So with that, let's get it! </p>
